# Conformal-HFT
Msc Applied Project on the applications of conformal prediction in an HFT setting for better model calibration and uncertainty quantification.

## Current Roadmap
- Try transforming the LOB model to numpy and wrap mapie on it.
- If previous step works go do the same on other models and compare.
- As a last resort just run a Neural Prophet, with built in CP and that's it.

## Possible paper structure
- Abstract
- Introduction/relevant literature
- Methodology: quick summary of conformal prediction and probabilistic ml, overview of DeepLOB & co, application on Mapie
- Empirical Results: apply to the same datasets as other papers
- Conclusion
